                History:<br>
                The Roman Empire was divided in half in the fourth century.<br>
                The eastern half, which we now refer to as the Byzantine Empire, included Egypt.<br> 
                Nonetheless, the Arabs took control of it in the seventh century. In 639, the Arabs invaded Egypt, and by 642, they controlled the whole country.<br>
                <br>It joined the Islamic Empire under Baghdad's control. Egypt did became independent in 868 under the leadership of Ahmed Ibn Tulun, but this freedom did not survive long.<br> 
                With the murder of his son and heir, Baghdad's power was reinstated.<br>
                The Tunisian Fatimids then conquered Egypt in 969. Up until 1171, Egypt was controlled by the Fatimids, who built Cairo, the nation's capital.
